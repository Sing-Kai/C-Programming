Test - Report

The main method of testing used for this assignment were self written functions that tested my other functions in teletext.c and graphics.c. The test functions mainly tested all functions that return an output or functions that initialized values was outputing and updating a value. Any functions that only contained functions that have already been tested were missed out, I make an assumption that if the smaller already tested functions pass, then these functions are working in order. 

When writting this piece of software the logic was done first, afterwards SDL and graphics wwere added on. In general, I used print functions that displayed the data in the array of structs. This allowed me to quickly check if the functions I built were updating the correct values. When doing the SDL graphics, a basic visual test was done to ensure everything was displaying correctly with the example files given. Anything displaying incorrectly meant there may be issues with the logic or the graphic/SDL functions, doing this meant if a bug was relating to logic early on then it wasn't discovered until later on.

All the test functions were written after the first 50% of assignment was done and working. This meant that no major bugs were discovered during the process. One difficulty I experience was that fucntions that were larger were more difficult to test. This did force me to reflect on my code and break them down into smaller functinos. Upon reflection, I should of taken the test driven development approach as this would have forced me to write smaller testable functions right from the start. Being unfamiliar with this process or testing in general, this would have been more time consuming strategy. However, this may have been the case initially but the opposite argument is that I would have resolved bugs quicker and earlier on.

I did not download any Unit testing framework for this assignment, again, being unfamiliar with process meant it would have been time consuming. Writting my own test functions meant they were taylored to my functions. However, I would like to explore downloadable testing frameworks more in the future.
